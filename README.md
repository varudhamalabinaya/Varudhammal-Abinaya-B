# Hi, I'm Varudhammal Abinaya

I’m a B.Tech Computer Science and Business Systems student at KS Rangasamy College of Technology, Tiruchengode.

Currently learning:
- DSA using Java (via Coding Ninjas)
- Preparing for AWS Certification

## About Me
I enjoy learning new tech, writing online, and exploring design tools.
I'm currently focused on DSA using Java and preparing for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification. I also write on Substack, sharing thoughts and personal reflections. Occasionally, I explore graphic design through courses or by experimenting with tools like Figma and Canva — often guided by ChatGPT!
